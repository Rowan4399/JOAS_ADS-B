\section{Conclusion}


This paper will present the design of an evaluation framework and its application to ADS-B data. 
The framework is intended to provide researchers and practitioners with practical tools to select appropriate cleaning strategies, 
balance data fidelity with usability, and build more reliable foundations for trajectory prediction, safety assessment, and air traffic management. 
In addition, the paper will contribute:
\begin{itemize}
  \item an overview of the current use of ADS-B data in the research domain, identifying and structuring clusters of algorithms in use;
  \item an analysis of the main trends in ADS-B data usage based on a systematic literature review;
  \item extraction of a representative set of algorithms that rely on ADS-B data and testing their robustness under varying data correction strategies; and
  \item conclusions on algorithm sensitivity to data cleaning, with a discussion of trade-offs between preprocessing, fidelity to original data, and downstream accuracy, as well as future research directions.
\end{itemize}
